## Session 3 - Basics of Species Distribution Models (SDMs)

Species distribution models are instrumental in predicting and understanding the geographic ranges of species. In this session, we will delve into the
use of dismo, SDMtune and sdmpredictors R packages, covering the basics of species distribution modelling. Participants will learn how to construct
predictive models and assess habitat suitability for species.

## Theory and Concept

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are fundamental tools in ecology and conservation biology, aiming to understand and predict the spatial
distribution of species based on environmental variables. At its core, SDMs are grounded in the ecological niche theory, which suggests that species
occupy specific ecological niches characterised by environmental conditions such as temperature, water quality, and habitat features. By quantifying
the relationship between species occurrence records and environmental variables through statistical modeling techniques, SDMs provide insights into
the ecological requirements and habitat preferences of species.

These models typically utilise various algorithms, including MaxEnt, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Models, to predict species distributions
across geographic areas. SDMs have diverse applications, from assessing the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions to informing
conservation planning and management strategies. However, they also come with limitations and uncertainties, including data quality issues,
assumptions about species-environment relationships, and challenges in extrapolating predictions to novel environmental conditions. Continuous
refinement and integration of multiple data sources and modeling approaches are essential for improving the accuracy and reliability of SDMs, thereby
enhancing their utility in addressing pressing ecological and conservation challenges. In this session, we will run though a quick example of how SDMs
are created in R, and the complexities of thier development and interpretation.

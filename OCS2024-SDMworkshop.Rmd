### Who are we?

<br>

**Mina** is a Research Associate in the Fish and Fisheries Lab at James Cook University. She first became interested in using R as a tool to wrangle
large datasets to assess risks posed by climate change to both animal populations and the livelihoods of human communities reliant upon them. She has 
worked as a teaching assistant at JCU, creating R boot camps and leading weekly workshops for students learning to model using **R**. 

<br>

**Vinay** is a Spatial Ecologist at the [Charles Darwin Foundation](https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/). He is an ecologist that is particularly
interested in using spatio-temporal datasets to understand animal movements and distributions patterns. He has considerable experience using **R** to
analyse and visualise large and complex spatial datasets. He has developed **R** code and packages to analyse 2 and 3 dimensional movement patterns of
animals using acoustic telemetry data from single study sites to continental scale arrays. Vinay's **R** codes can be found on his [github
page](https://github.com/vinayudyawer).

### Course outline

**In this course you will learn to work with spatial datasets and spatial models using R**. This workshop will
demonstrate how **R** can make the processing of spatial data much quicker and easier than using standard GIS software! At the end of this workshop
you will also have the annotated **R** code that you can re-run at any time, share with collaborators and build on with those newly acquired data!

We designed this course not to comprehensively cover all the tools in **R**, but rather to give you an understanding of options on how to analyse your
satellite telemetry data and build spatial models. Every new project comes with its own problems and questions and you will need to be
independent, patient and creative to solve these challenges. It makes sense to invest time in becoming familiar with **R**, because today **R** is the
leading platform for environmental data analysis and has some other functionalities which may surprise you!

<br>

This **R** workshop is intended to run across 4 sessions.

<br>

-   **Session 1:** *Basics of data cleaning and mapping using telemetry data*

This session will address the fundamentals of data pre-processing and visualisation, utilising the `tidyverse`, `sf`, and `ggspatial` R packages. 
Participants will learn efficient data cleaning methods, organisation of telemetry data, and the creation of geospatial visualisations to gain 
insights into animal movements.

<br>

-   **Session 2:** *Using satellite telemetry data to define behaviours*

The second session will introduce participants to the `aniMotum` package, a valuable tool for analysing animal movement data. Attendees will acquire
the skills to define distinct behavioural patterns exhibited by tracked animals.

<br>

-   **Session 3:** *Basics of Species Distribution Models (SDMs)*

Species distribution models are instrumental in predicting and understanding the geographic ranges of species. In this session, we will delve into the 
theory of SDMs and use a number of R tools inluding `dismo`, `mgcv` and `randomForest` R packages, covering the basics of species distribution modelling. 
Participants will learn how to construct predictive models and assess habitat suitability for species.

<br>

-   **Session 4:** *Using telemetry data to define species distributions*

The final session focuses on integrating telemetry data with species distribution models, enabling the creation of comprehensive distribution maps and the 
analysis of how environmental variables influence species presence and absence.

### Course Resources

The course resources will be emailed to you prior to the workshop. However, you can also access the data and scripts we will work through in this
course following these steps:

**1. Download the course materials from [this link](https://github.com/vinayudyawer/SEA-workshop2023/raw/main/data/SEA-Workshop-2023.zip).**

**2. Unzip the downloaded file. It should have the following two folders and a html file:**

- [***Code***]{style="color:darkblue"} *folder*
- [***Data***]{style="color:darkblue"} *folder*
- [***OCS2024-SDMworkshop.html***]{style="color:darkblue"} *file*

**3. Save all the files in a location on your computer you can find again during the workshop**

## Software installation

<br>

Processing and analysing large datasets like those from animal telemetry work can require a huge investment in time: rearranging data, removing
erroneous values, purchasing, downloading and learning the new software, and running analyses. Furthermore merging together Excel spreadsheets,
filtering data and preparing data for statistical analyses and plotting in different software packages can introduce all sorts of errors.

**R** is a powerful language for data wrangling and analysis because...

-   It is relatively *fast* to run and process commands
-   You can create *repeatable* scripts
-   You can *trace errors* back to their source
-   You can *share your scripts* with other people
-   It is *easy to identify errors* in large data sets
-   Having your data in **R** opens up a huge array of cutting edge analysis tools.
-   **R** is also totally **FREE!**

<br>

**Installing packages**

Part of the reason **R** has become so popular is the vast array of packages that are freely available and highly accessible. In the last few years,
the number of packages has grown exponentially [\> 10,000 on CRAN!](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/01/cran-10000.html) These can help you to
do a galaxy of different things in **R**, including *running complex analyses*, drawing *beautiful figures*, running *R as a GIS*, constructing your
own *R packages*, building *web pages* and even *writing R course handbooks* like this one!

Let's suppose you want to load the `sf` package to access this package's incredible spatial functionality. If this package is not already installed on
your machine, you can download it from the web by using the following command in **R**.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
install.packages("sf", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

In this example, `sf` is the package to be downloaded and '<http://cran.us.r-project.org>' is the repository where the package will be accessed from.

<br>

More recently, package developers have also used other platforms like [**GitHub**](https://github.com) to house **R** packages. This has enabled users
to access packages that are actively being updated and enable developers to fix problems and develop new features with user feedback.

The `remotes` and `devtools` **R** packages have enabled the installation of packages directly from platforms like **GitHub**. For example, if we want
want to download the `visreg` package from the github repository, we can use the `install_github()` package to do it like this:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
remotes::install_github("pbreheny/visreg")
```

### Installation instructions:

For this course, make sure you have downloaded and installed the most updated versions of the following software:

<br>

**1. Download R for your relevant operating system from the [CRAN website](https://cran.rstudio.com)** <br>

**2. Download RStudio for your relevant operating system from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)** <br>

**3. Once you've installed the above software, make sure you install the following packages prior to the start of the course**

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
## Packages that are on CRAN

install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "sf",
                   "terra",
                   "raster",
                   "lubridate",
                   "ggspatial",
                   "ggaminate",
                   "leaflet",
                   "remotes",
                   "dismo",
                   "stats",
                   "mgcv",
                   "mgcViz",
                   "randomForest",
                   "plotly",
                   "patchwork"
                   ))

## Install packages from GitHub and other external repositories

remotes::install_github("r-spatial/mapview", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("pbreheny/visreg", build_vignettes = TRUE)
install.packages("aniMotum", 
                 repos = c("https://cloud.r-project.org",
                 "https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev"),
                 dependencies = TRUE)

```

When downloading from **GitHub**, the R console will ask you if it should also update packages. In most cases, you can skip updating packages (**option [3]**)
as this often stalls the whole process of downloading the package. If there are package dependencies, these will often be downloaded automatically (but not
always!). If you want to update the packages you have, you can do it separately.

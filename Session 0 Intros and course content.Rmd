### Who are we?

<br>

**Mina** is...

**Vinay** is a Spatial Ecologist at the [Charles Darwin Foundation](https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/). He is an ecologist that is particularly
interested in using spatio-temporal datasets to understand animal movements and distributions patterns. He has considerable experience using **R** to
analyse and visualise large and complex spatial datasets. He has developed **R** code and packages to analyse 2 and 3 dimensional movement patterns of
animals using acoustic telemetry data from single study sites to continental scale arrays. Vinay's **R** codes can be found on his [github
page](https://github.com/vinayudyawer).

### Course outline

**In this course you will learn about different ways to analyse and interpret your aquatic telemetry datasets using R**. This workshop will
demonstrate how **R** can make the processing of spatial data much quicker and easier than using standard GIS software! At the end of this workshop
you will also have the annotated **R** code that you can re-run at any time, share with collaborators and build on with those newly acquired data!

I designed this course not to comprehensively cover all the tools in **R**, but rather to give you an understanding of options on how to analyse your
telemetry data (both from satellite and acoustic tags). Every new project comes with its own problems and questions and you will need to be
independent, patient and creative to solve these challenges. It makes sense to invest time in becoming familiar with **R**, because today **R** is the
leading platform for environmental data analysis and has some other functionalities which may surprise you!

<br>

This **R** workshop is intended to run across 3 sessions.

<br>

-   **Session 1:** *Getting familiar with R and spatial data*

1.  **Import** and **explore** datasets [*tidyverse*](http://tidyverse.org/)
2.  Working with **Spatial objects** using [*sf*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [*ggspatial*](https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/) and
    [*mapview*](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/)

<br>

-   **Session 2:** *Working with satellite telemetry data*

1.  Understanding the data structure from **satellite tags**
2.  **Processing** and **visualising** satellite tag data using the [*aniMotum*](https://github.com/ianjonsen/aniMotum) package

<br>

-   **Session 3:** *Working with passive acoustic telemetry data*

1.  Understanding the data structure from **acoustic telemetry data**
2.  Using the [*VTrack*](http://github.com/rossdwyer/VTrack) R package to explore patterns in animal detections and dispersal
3.  Using the [*re**mo**ra*](https://github.com/IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora) R package to interactively explore your telemetry data

### Course Resources

The course resources will be emailed to you prior to the workshop. However, you can also access the data and scripts we will work through in this
course following these steps:

**1. Download the course materials from [this link](https://github.com/vinayudyawer/SEA-workshop2023/raw/main/data/SEA-Workshop-2023.zip).**

**2. Unzip the downloaded file. It should have the following two folders and a html file:**

- [***Code***]{style="color:darkblue"} *folder*
- [***Data***]{style="color:darkblue"} *folder*
- [***SEA-workshop2023.html***]{style="color:darkblue"} *file*

**3. Save all the files in a location on your computer you can find again during the workshop**

## Software installation

<br>

Processing and analysing large datasets like those from animal telemetry work can require a huge investment in time: rearranging data, removing
erroneous values, purchasing, downloading and learning the new software, and running analyses. Furthermore merging together Excel spreadsheets,
filtering data and preparing data for statistical analyses and plotting in different software packages can introduce all sorts of errors.

**R** is a powerful language for data wrangling and analysis because...

-   It is relatively *fast* to run and process commands
-   You can create *repeatable* scripts
-   You can *trace errors* back to their source
-   You can *share your scripts* with other people
-   It is *easy to identify errors* in large data sets
-   Having your data in **R** opens up a huge array of cutting edge analysis tools.
-   **R** is also totally **FREE!**

<br>

**Installing packages**

Part of the reason **R** has become so popular is the vast array of packages that are freely available and highly accessible. In the last few years,
the number of packages has grown exponentially [\> 10,000 on CRAN!](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/01/cran-10000.html) These can help you to
do a galaxy of different things in **R**, including *running complex analyses*, drawing *beautiful figures*, running *R as a GIS*, constructing your
own *R packages*, building *web pages* and even *writing R course handbooks* like this one!

Let's suppose you want to load the `sf` package to access this package's incredible spatial functionality. If this package is not already installed on
your machine, you can download it from the web by using the following command in **R**.

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
install.packages("sf", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

In this example, `sf` is the package to be downloaded and '<http://cran.us.r-project.org>' is the repository where the package will be accessed from.

<br>

More recently, package developers have also used other platforms like [**GitHub**](https://github.com) to house **R** packages. This has enabled users
to access packages that are actively being updated and enable developers to fix problems and develop new features with user feedback.

The `remotes` and `devtools` **R** packages have enabled the installation of packages directly from platforms like **GitHub**. For example, if we want
want to download the `VTrack` package from the github repository, we can use the `install_github()` package to do it like this:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
remotes::install_github("rossdwyer/VTrack")
```

### Installation instructions:

For this course, make sure you have downloaded and installed the most updated versions of the following software:

<br>

**1. Download R for your relevant operating system from the [CRAN website](https://cran.rstudio.com)** <br>

**2. Download RStudio for your relevant operating system from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)** <br>

**3. Once you've installed the above software, make sure you install the following packages prior to the start of the course**

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
## Packages that are on CRAN

install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "sf",
                   "ggspatial",
                   "leaflet",
                   "remotes"))

## Install packages from GitHub and other external repositories

remotes::install_github("r-spatial/mapview", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("rossdwyer/VTrack", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github('IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora', build_vignettes = TRUE)
install.packages("aniMotum", 
                 repos = c("https://cloud.r-project.org",
                 "https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev"),
                 dependencies = TRUE)

```

When downloading from **GitHub**, the R console will ask you if it should also update packages. In most cases, you can skip updating packages (**option [3]**)
as this often stalls the whole process of downloading the package. If there are package dependencies, these will often be downloaded automatically (but not
always!). If you want to update the packages you have, you can do it separately.
